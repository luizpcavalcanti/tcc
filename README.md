First, install everything from the "SETUP" section, then, use the "CHARACTER GENERATOR (AUTOMATIC) - RUN" to generate characters, press '1' (one) and then choose a name.


After creating a character, go to "FRAMEWORK - CHARACTER SELECTION", select the character you want, and hit "FRAMEWORK - ASSET GENERATION (IMAGES and TEXTS)" to generate the assets.


You can go to the following sections to download a zip with the image files, and the next, to download a pdf with all the text generated.

I'ts also possible to generate songs based on the character description, and other texts generated during the process. To download the songs, click with the right button on the player, and select "save file as".
